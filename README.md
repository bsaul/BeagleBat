# About beaglebat

The goal of beaglebat is to create an automated acoustic monitoring station built on the Beaglebone.

THIS is very much a work in progress, as I learn my around the Beaglebone, the Linux OS, and programming in C.

## Using beaglebat

After beaglebat is compiled and a `/media/store` directory created.

At the command line, type:

```
./beaglebat record 5
```

This records for 5 seconds.
